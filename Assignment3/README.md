Through the lens of SDG 5, this visualization illustrates the high rate of maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions in the world. In addition, it visualizes a direct correlation between lack of electricity in health care facilities and an increase in maternal mortality.  

The code is still in its infancy stages.

I'm hoping that proving this direct correlation will lead to investments in renewable energy in healthcare facilities as it will go directly to saving women's lives.
